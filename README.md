# GENERIC-TEXT-TO-SQL

Our problem statement is generating structured query language (SQL) from the generic text, with some modification in the Basic BERT Model. 
The ultimate aim of this approach is to enhance the model's comprehension of the underlying data, thereby improving its accuracy in generating 
SQL queries that precisely capture the user's intent.
We leverage semantic ability to match information of the table cells ,table header and question string to construct external vector emebeddings
for BERT to directly take insights from and improve WHERE value prediction accuracy. Built on the foundations of SQLOva and Execution guided beam encoding.
